<h1>Explaination:</h1> 
This application was partially completed  there was also some error .
            <br>We have to complete this application as explained below.
           
  #This application start from class EmployeeController

In the main method we can see we are creating the list of employee, and then validating it and saving the valid employee.

You need to creat employee list from csv file instead of for loop, and implement getEmployeesize method to remove error.
<br>Keep SOLID principle and Functional programing in mind while doing exercise.
